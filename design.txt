---Keep record of their lessons (4 to 6) and completion status
- Display potential lessons during sign up
--Allow users to see their details and alter them
- Lessons are run using Javascript slides/CSS slides
-- Javascript test at the end to complete course
--- Completion score depends on viewing lessons and passing the course test (50:50 split)
